# Employee Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning

Developed a machine learning model to predict employee attrition using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The project demonstrates end-to-end preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and basic interpretation.

Key features
- End-to-end Jupyter notebook demonstrating data cleaning, feature engineering, model training and evaluation
- Models included: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Preprocessing: encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, feature scaling
- Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix

Quick start
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/japthisuraj/Employee-Attrition-prediction-Using-Machine-Learning.git
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
3. Install dependencies (if requirements.txt is present):
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Launch the Jupyter notebook:
   jupyter notebook
   Open the notebook(s) in the repository to follow the preprocessing, training and evaluation steps.

Results
See the notebooks for training logs, evaluation tables and confusion matrices comparing models. Use the notebooks to reproduce reported metrics and plots.
