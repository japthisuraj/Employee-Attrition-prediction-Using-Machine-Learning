# Employee-Attrition-prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Developed a machine learning model to predict employee attrition using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Performed data preprocessing including encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and feature scaling for optimal model performance.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, and visualized insights to support HR decision-making.
